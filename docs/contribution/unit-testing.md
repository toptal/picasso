# Unit Testing

## Debugging

Picasso has 3 launch configurations for VS Code to debug unit tests:

1. `Debug Tests - Single Run` - runs all tests once.
2. `Debug Tests - Watch Mode` - runs all tests in watch mode.
3. `Debug Tests - Current File` - runs the test suites from the currently open filed.
