# Available commands via `@toptal-bot`

You can run some or all stages of the [Jenkins job](https://jenkins.toptal.net/job/picasso-pr-specs/) which is responsible for running tests.
This job is triggered in every PR automatically with all the stages enabled, but if Jenkins gets stuck or you changed the PR title and want to re-run `danger` check,
it can be useful to run just a part of the Jenkins pipeline or run only a specific stage like `danger`.

## Whole list of the available commands:

- `@toptal-bot run all` - Run whole pipeline
- `@toptal-bot run build` - Check build
- `@toptal-bot run deploy:documentation` - Deploy documentation
- `@toptal-bot run package:alpha-release` - Release alpha version
