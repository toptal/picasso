# Breakpoints and breakpoint ranges

- [BASE design / Grids](https://www.figma.com/file/q2nvjiyO2CLqBv4DeJnU3i/Product-Library-Documentation?node-id=4533%3A28468&t=vx43Ao8lyKnJMz9U-1)

## Problem

Picasso breakpoints and responsiveness in general has to be in sync with [BASE design guidelines](https://www.figma.com/file/q2nvjiyO2CLqBv4DeJnU3i/Product-Library-Documentation?node-id=4533%3A28468&t=RruM6iH4OeX5Csm7-1). Current breakpoints and breakpoint ranges are presented below (as well as in https://picasso.toptal.net/?path=/story/utils-breakpoints--breakpoints):

```
// Breakpoints
xs: 0px,
sm: 576px,
md: 768px,
lg: 992px,
xl: 1920px,

// Breakpoint ranges
small:       0-575px
medium:      576-767px
large:       768-991px
extra-large: 992px+
```

## Proposal

[Breakpoints from BASE design](https://www.figma.com/file/q2nvjiyO2CLqBv4DeJnU3i/Product-Library-Documentation?node-id=4533%3A28468&t=RruM6iH4OeX5Csm7-1) should be fully supported in Picasso. Proposed breakpoints and breakpoint ranges that correspond to the BASE design:

```
// Breakpoints
xs:  0px    (extra-small)
sm:  480px  (small)
md:  768px  (medium)
lg:  1024px (large)
xl:  1440px (extra-large)

// Breakpoint ranges
xs:  0-479px
sm:  480-767px
md:  768-1023px
lg:  1024-1439px
xl:  1440px+

Value         |0px     480px    768px    1024px   1440px
Key           |xs      sm       md       lg       xl
Screen width  |--------|--------|--------|--------|-------->
Range         |   xs   |   sm   |   md   |   lg   |   xl
```

## Decision

In order to adopt new breakpoints in Picasso, the following steps need to be taken:

- update breakpoints in Picasso
- [Grid item](https://picasso.toptal.net/?path=/story/layout-grid--grid), [Radio group](https://picasso.toptal.net/?path=/story/forms-radio--radio), and [Checkbox group](https://picasso.toptal.net/?path=/story/forms-checkbox--checkbox) have to extend the list of supported breakpoints â€“ `extra-small` and `extra-large` have to be added (for now it is only `small`, `medium`, and `large`)
- [Grid](https://picasso.toptal.net/?path=/story/layout-grid--grid)'s `spacing` default property value has to depend on screen size (aligned with [BASE design breakpoints table](https://www.figma.com/file/q2nvjiyO2CLqBv4DeJnU3i/Product-Library-Documentation?node-id=4533%3A28468&t=O6NGIGAxAbtfzWfm-1)), unless it is explicitly specified by user
- come up with migration guide and announce it upon merge if all the changes to `master` branch
