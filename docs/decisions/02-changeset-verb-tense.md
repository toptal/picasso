# Changeset Verb Tense

## Problem

Inconsistency in verb tense when writing changesets. Now we have a combination of two, **past simple** and **present simple**.

### Proposal

Use **present simple**

- Example: `add new Settings16 icon`

### Benefits
- We already use it for [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), so if we decide to stop using changesets and generate changelog from commits, we will be consistent
