# Spacing

## Problem

BASE design defines [rules](https://toptal-core.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Base/pages/3217031216/Spacing) on how to use spacing between page elements. Picasso does not provide BASE spacings, so consumers can not implement BASE-compatible designs in their applications.

## Current situation

Picasso provides a specialised `SpacingType` type that can be either a numeric value of `rem` units or one of the pre-defined string constants (`xsmall`, `small`, etc.) that are resolved to a number of `rem` units.

As an example, the `Container` component has a `top` property that has `SpacingType` type. Based on the statistics of `top` property usage (searching for its occurrences in [this](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Atoptal+%22+top%3D%7B%22&type=code&p=1) GitHub search), Picasso consumers frequently use both numeric values and string constants.

All of the `SpacingType` string constants resolve to numeric values that are present in [BASE design spacings](https://toptal-core.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Base/pages/3217031216/Spacing#Base-Increment). Some of the BASE design spacings do not have a counterpart between `SpacingType` string constants. There are 5 `SpacingType` string constants and 12 BASE design spacings â€“ for example, there is no string constant for `spacing-12` spacing.

## Existing approaches

- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/theme#spacing) exports spacings in a form of key-value pairs, where `key` is the pixel number value and `value` is the `rem` units string value

```ts
const spacing = {
  space: {
    px: '1px',
    0.5: '0.125rem',
    1: '0.25rem',
    ...
  }
}
```

- [Caliber](https://github.com/toptal/caliber/blob/9a0b91110f1c82e07d30f684bb42b49e0e34f918/tailwind.preset.design-tokens.js#L2) defines spacings as key-value pairs and exports spacings in a form of CSS classes generated with TailwindCSS

```js
// Design tokens preset
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    spacing: {
      ...
      4: '16px',
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

```css
...
/* padding: 16px */
.p-4
/* padding-top: 16px */
.pt-4
...
```

## Proposal

Picasso has to export spacing, compatible with [BASE design](https://toptal-core.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Base/pages/3217031216/Spacing). The legacy way of specifying spacing (numbers and string constants) has to be gradually deprecated to encourage usage of BASE spacings. The [How to use spacings](https://picasso.toptal.net/?path=/story/tutorials-how-to-use-spacings--how-to-use-spacings) tutorial has to be updated to contain up-to-date guidelines on using a new spacing system.

### Technical implementation

Picasso has to provide a new `spacing` object that includes proposed spacings in a form of key-value pairs (where the key is the index of the increment and the value is a corresponding value in `rem` unit)

```ts
// New internal type
type PicassoSpacing = 0 | 0.25 | 0.5 | 0.75 | 1 | 1.5 | 2 | 2.5 | 3

export const spacing: Record<number, PicassoSpacing> = {
  0: 0,
  1: 0.25,
  ...
  10: 2.5,
  12: 3,
}
...
// SpacingType is extended with PicassoSpacing
export type SpacingType =
  | number
  | SizeType<'xsmall' | 'small' | 'medium' | 'large' | 'xlarge'>
  | PicassoSpacing
```

Exported `spacing` object is reused by components with spacing properties (`top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`, `gap`, and `padded` properties in Container component and `offset` property in Dropdown component).

```tsx
import { spacing } from '@toptal/picasso/utils'
...
<Container top={spacing[6]}/>
```

### Deprecation of existing approaches

After BASE spacing is introduced, the number and string constants approaches of specifying spacing have to be deprecated (in 3 weeks). The deprecation plan consists of two steps:

- forbid number spacing, throw TypeScript error. For number values, that map to BASE spacing, codemod should be used for replacement. For custom values that do not map to BASE spacing, manual replacement should be applied by owning Teams.

```jsx
// Maps to BASE spacing
<Container top={1}/>
// becomes
<Container top={spacing[4]}/>

// Does not map to BASE spacing, has to be addressed manually, otherwise TypeScript error is thrown
<Container top={0.1}/>
```

Statistics: the `org:toptal "top={"` [GitHub search](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Atoptal+%22top%3D%7B%22&type=code) finds 10 occurences of non-BASE values (for example, `0.1`, `-2`. `0.125`, etc.) used in `Container.top` property 

- forbid string constants and replace them with corresponding BASE spacings. Every string constant maps to BASE spacing, so codemod should be used for replacement.

```jsx
type Sizes = 'xxsmall' | 'xsmall' | 'small' | 'medium' | 'large' | 'xlarge'

export enum SpacingEnum {
  xsmall = 0.5,  // maps to spacing[2]
  small = 1,     // maps to spacing[4]
  medium = 1.5,  // maps to spacing[6]
  large = 2,     // maps to spacing[8]
  xlarge = 2.5,  // maps to spacing[10]
}

// Example of conversion
<Container top='small'/>
// becomes
<Container top={spacing[4]}/>
```

The goal is to remove `number` and `SizeType` from `SpacingType` union type.

```jsx
export type SpacingType = PicassoSpacing
```

## Alternative approaches

- Intoroduce responsive spacing tokens with different values depending on the screen size

This is one of the approaches used on the market (as an example, [Audi Design System](https://react.ui.audi/?path=/docs/brand-identity-design-tokens--page#layout-system)). However, the responsive spacing tokens idea was abandoned after discussion with the Design Team due to its complexity and unclear benefits.

- Provide BASE design spacings as separate constants

```ts
export const spacing0 = 0
export const spacing1 = 0.25
...
export const spacing10 = 2.5
export const spacing12 = 3
```

This approach is not consistent with the way `breakpoint` and `color` objects are exposed by Picasso (they are objects with key-value pairs, not as a separate constants)

- Provide BASE design spacings as object with string values in `rem` units

```ts
export const spacing = {
  0: `0rem`,
  1: `0.25rem`,
  ...
  10: `2.5rem`,
  12: `3rem`,
}
```

This approach complicates handling of new spacing values in related components (`Container` and `Dropdown`), as they will have to handle new case of `Nrem` string besides the existing `SpacingType` without any significant advantage compared to the proposed approach.
