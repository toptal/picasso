## Supported browsers list

### High priority support

- **Chrome** (~70%)
- **Firefox** (~8%)
- **Safari +11** (~10%)

###### Browsers that are tested and fully maintained

### Low priority support

- **EDGE** (~1.5%)
- **IE11** (~1.5%)

###### Browsers that are **not tested** (may only be tested during major releases) and are partially maintained (only the critical issues are addressed, minor visual inconsistencies are not ). 

These **stats** are taken from our **Google Analytics** account, filtering users that are coming to `/platform*` or `Portal` projects.

We do not specify supported versions for **evergreen browsers** - **Chrome**, **Firefox** and **EDGE** as it is automatically updated.

Our main strategy is to support only most popular browsers, however having a handful of IE and EDGE users in enterprise scope we must ensure at least non-breaking experience for them.

## Supported devices

Most of our users are using **desktop devices (~90%)** we have fair amount of **mobile users (~10%)** and the rest are **tablet users (<1%)**. However we do not aim to support specific devices rather than support specific screen sizes.

- **Small** (0 - 576px)
- **Medium** (577px - 768px)
- **Large** (768px and more)
