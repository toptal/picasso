    Three common ways for a prospective owner to acquire a dog is from pet
    shops, private owners, or shelters. A pet shop may be the most convenient
    way to buy a dog. Buying a dog from a private owner allows you to assess the
    pedigree and upbringing of your dog before choosing to take it home. Lastly,
    finding your dog from a shelter, helps give a good home to a dog who may not
    find one so readily.
