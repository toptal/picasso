/** 
 * In July 2023 we tried to expose the Calendar component. It turned out there was no Calendar designs in BASE.
 * Since no one needed it at the time, we decided to 1) postpone the work on stand alone Calendar 2) hide it back to discourage its usage.
 * When the work is resumed - just uncomment the code below and work from there. Also check out PR #3729 where we refactored Calendar to remove its Container and footer.
 * Use this search to find Calendar usages: https://github.com/search?q=org%3Atoptal+-repo%3Atoptal%2Fpicasso+++%2Fimport.*Calendar+.*picasso%2F&type=code
