# @toptal/picasso-modal-context

## 100.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#5059](https://github.com/toptal/picasso/pull/5059) [`de9dba3`](https://github.com/toptal/picasso/commit/de9dba37e3d371d4bf26fb025c555d8e679dcaa5) Thanks [@vedrani](https://github.com/vedrani)!
  Raise the `react` and `react-dom` peer-dependency floor to React 17.

  - raise the `react` and `react-dom` peer-dependency floor from `>=16.12.0` to `>=17.0.0` across all Picasso packages — **React 16 is no longer supported**. Picasso components now depend on `@base-ui/react`, which requires React 17+ (`^17 || ^18 || ^19`), so React 16 could no longer be honored in practice.
  - this is a peer-range change only — no runtime or API changes. Existing upper bounds are untouched: packages currently capped at `<19.0.0` stay capped (lifting that cap to admit React 19 is tracked separately in PF-2236 / PF-2262).
  - consumer action: ensure `react` and `react-dom` resolve to `>=17`. [PF-2237]

  Re-baseline the entire Picasso library to a single unified major version (v100) as part of the @base-ui/react modernization.
  - all Picasso packages are released together at v100.0.0 as one unified version.
  - no API or behavior change comes from this re-baseline itself; see each package's changelog for the specific modernization changes it received.

### Minor Changes

- [#5059](https://github.com/toptal/picasso/pull/5059) [`de9dba3`](https://github.com/toptal/picasso/commit/de9dba37e3d371d4bf26fb025c555d8e679dcaa5) Thanks [@vedrani](https://github.com/vedrani)!
  Align the `react` and `react-dom` peer-dependency range to a uniform `>=17.0.0 < 19.0.0` across all Picasso packages.
  - previously the base-UI-migrated packages declared an uncapped `react` peer (`>=17.0.0`) while the rest were capped at `< 19.0.0`; this unifies the whole library on one supported range so consumers see a consistent React requirement.
  - react 19 support is intentionally deferred — lifting the `< 19.0.0` cap across all packages, once validated, is tracked in PF-2262.
  - peer-range change only; no runtime or API changes.

### ModalContext

- drop the vestigial `@material-ui/core` peer-dependency (source is a React context provider that imports nothing from MUI). Public API unchanged; behavioral parity.

- migrate to Picasso by Parts
  - picasso is now distributed as a set of independent packages with the main package `@toptal/picasso` now being a collection of re-exported packages
