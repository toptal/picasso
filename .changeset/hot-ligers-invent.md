- add a hint background color on the component field to show preselected fill (automatically filled)
- this feature is disabled by default, you can turn it on in the form config
- update `@toptal/picasso@^31.12.1` to support new visual state (**BREAKING CHANGE**)

```
<ConfigProvider value={{ highlightAutofill: true }}>
```
