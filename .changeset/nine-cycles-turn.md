- all the Picasso Forms components exported from `picasso-forms` are now available to be directly imported from the root entry point
- compound usage of `Form` is now deprecated, you can replace the compound `Form` with `FormNonCompound` (in the future compound Form will no longer be available)
- added a codemod to effortlessly migrate your compound `Form` to separate components `npx @toptal/picasso-codemod v52.2.0/non-compound-forms`
