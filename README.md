This repository is the home for all of Toptal's reusable UI, split up into distinct monorepo packages distributed through NPM:

- [@toptal/picasso](./packages/picasso/README.md) - core UI building blocks
- [@toptal/picasso-charts](./packages/picasso-charts/README.md) - reusable charts, based on `recharts`
- [@toptal/picasso-forms](./packages/picasso-forms/README.md) - a form solution, based on `react-final-form`
- [@toptal/picasso-codemod](./packages/picasso-codemod/README.md) - scripts that help developers migrate to the latest version
- [@toptal/picasso-shared](./packages/picasso-shared/README.md) - shared utilities between the packages

## Icons

### Add an icon

In Picasso, we keep icons in `svg` format and transform them into react components to make usage in react projects easier. This transformation is processed by the [`svgr`](https://github.com/smooth-code/svgr) tool.

To add a new Icon to Picasso library please follow these steps:

1. Prepare your SVG:
   - Make sure that it has `viewBox` attribute specified
   - Make sure that `viewBox` size is `0 0 16 16` (be careful this isn't just a simple value set!)
   - Make sure all paths are expanded and strokes are not used
2. Add your SVG file(s) to the Picasso project:
   > packages/picasso/src/Icon/svg/[your_icon_name].svg
3. Run the command

   ```js
   yarn generate:icons
   ```

   This command will prepare corresponding react components for your icons
   and add export statements to `packages/picasso/src/Icon/index.ts`

After Picasso will be released with your changes you can start using your Icon as described in the [Icons section](https://picasso.toptal.net/?path=/story/components-folder--icon#icon).

## Adding new packages

1. Create a new folder under `/packages` and add to it:

   - `package.json` by running `lerna add`. Specify `Toptal` as the author and `src/index.ts` in the `main` key
   - `tsconfig.build.json` using this template with paths to the `node_modules` of any used packages from the `/packages` directory

   ```json
   {
     "extends": "../../tsconfig.build.json",
     "compilerOptions": {
       "outDir": "./build",
       "paths": {
         "@toptal/picasso/*": ["node_modules/@toptal/picasso/src/*"],
         "@toptal/picasso": ["node_modules/@toptal/picasso/src/index"]
       }
     },
     "include": ["./src/**/*"],
     "exclude": [
       "**/*.example.jsx",
       "**/*.example.tsx",
       "**/test.jsx",
       "**/test.tsx"
     ]
   }
   ```

   - `CHANGELOG.md` using this template (All notable changes to the package will be documented in this file automatically)

   ```md
   # Change Log

   All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
   See [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) for commit guidelines.
   ```

2. Add the new package to:

   - the `paths` key in `/tsconfig.json`
   - the `alias` key in `/.storybook/webpack.config.js`
   - the `imports` variable in `/.storybook/components/CodeExample/CodeExample.tsx`
   - the new record to Dockerfile

## Linking with other projects

In order to develop or debug Picasso in parallel with your project without the need to publish new Picasso versions, you need to link Picasso to your project. And once finished unlink it.
You will probably notice that linking process links `@toptal/picasso` and `react`. It is due to React restriction of only once instance used in the project [[1]](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14257#issuecomment-439967377) [[2]](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13991#issuecomment-463486871), so we link to Picasso's `react` version.

### Link

To link Picasso follow these steps:

In Picasso project directory:

1. Checkout Picasso project from [Github](https://github.com/toptal/picasso)
2. Install Picasso dependencies with `yarn install`
3. Build Picasso inside Picasso package folder (`./packages/picasso/`) with `yarn build:package`
4. Create a link with running in the root path `yarn symlink` (creates all links to Picasso packages and React link)

In your project directory:

1. Link Picasso and React with `yarn link @toptal/picasso react`
2. Start your project and changes in Picasso will be visible in your project!

### Unlink

To unlink Picasso follow these steps:

In your project directory:

1. Unlink Picasso with `yarn unlink @toptal/picasso react`
2. Re-install dependencies with `yarn install --force`

(Optional) In Picasso project directory:

1. Unlink with `yarn symlink:off`
2. Re-install dependencies with `yarn install --force`

### Tree shaking

If you use [davinci](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@toptal/davinci) to manage your application - tree shaking works by default when you build your project in the `production` mode.

In other cases when you use custom webpack build configuration you should check these three things to make sure you will have Picasso tree-shaked:

1. You run your build in `production` mode
2. You are not transforming your ES modules into `commonjs` during the build process. Usually, it's default behavior of popular babel presets - [modules configuration](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#modules)
3. You have `sideEffects` prop in your `package.json` set to `false` value or don't have it at all

Have a happy tree shaking! :)
