- [@toptal/picasso](./packages/picasso/README.md) - core UI building blocks
- [@toptal/picasso-charts](./packages/picasso-charts/README.md) - reusable charts, based on `recharts`
- [@toptal/picasso-forms](./packages/picasso-forms/README.md) - a form solution, based on `react-final-form`
- [@toptal/picasso-codemod](./packages/picasso-codemod/README.md) - scripts that help developers migrate to the latest version
- [@toptal/picasso-shared](./packages/picasso-shared/README.md) - shared utilities between the packages

## Contributing

## Supported browsers

Picasso guarantees to work in Chrome and it supports other browsers specified in `@toptal/browserslist-config` package.

## Release policy

Changes in peer dependencies, breaking changes in component API or behavior, supported NodeJS version, result in major releases.

Changes in dev dependencies, component HTML structure, or visual changes are not considered as breaking changes and result in minor or patch releases.

## Running storybook

In order to run storybook you need to execute `yarn start` which will spin up storybook server on <http://localhost:9001>.

## Adding icons and pictograms

In Picasso, we keep icons and pictograms in `svg` format and transform them into React components to make usage in React projects easier. This transformation is processed by the [`svgr`](https://github.com/smooth-code/svgr) tool.

Pictograms are stored in a separate package due to their size and use cases.

To add a new icon to `@toptal/picasso` or pictogram to `@toptal/picasso-pictograms` please follow these steps:

1. Prepare your SVG:
   - Make sure that it has `viewBox` attribute specified
   - Make sure that `viewBox` sizes are `0 0 16 16` and `0 0 24 24` for icon (there should always be two icon variants) and `0 0 64 64` for pictogram (be careful this isn't just a simple value set!)
   - Make sure all paths are expanded and strokes are not used
2. Add your SVG file(s) to the Picasso project:

   ```bash
   packages/picasso/src/Icon/svg/[your_icon_name].svg                       # icons
   packages/picasso-pictograms/src/Pictograms/svg/[your_pictogram_name].svg # pictograms
   ```

3. Run the command

   ```bash
   yarn generate:svg-components # runs generation for icons and pictograms
   yarn generate:icons          # generates icons
   yarn generate:pictograms     # generates pictograms
   ```

   This command will prepare corresponding react components and add export statements index files.

After Picasso will be released with your changes you can start using your icons and pictograms as described in the [Icons section](https://picasso.toptal.net/?path=/story/components-folder--icon#icon) and [Pictograms section](https://picasso.toptal.net/?path=/story/picasso-pictograms-pictograms--pictograms).

## Adding new packages

1. Create a new folder under `/packages` and add to it:

   - `package.json` by running `lerna add`. Specify `Toptal` as the author and `src/index.ts` in the `main` key
   - `tsconfig.build.json` using this template with paths to the `node_modules` of any used packages from the `/packages` directory

   ```json
   {
     "extends": "../../tsconfig.build.json",
     "compilerOptions": {
       "outDir": "./build",
       "paths": {
         "@toptal/picasso/*": ["node_modules/@toptal/picasso/src/*"],
         "@toptal/picasso": ["node_modules/@toptal/picasso/src/index"]
       }
     },
     "include": ["./src/**/*"],
     "exclude": [
       "**/*.example.jsx",
       "**/*.example.tsx",
       "**/test.jsx",
       "**/test.tsx"
     ]
   }
   ```

   - `CHANGELOG.md` using this template (All notable changes to the package will be documented in this file automatically)

   ```md
   # Change Log

   All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
   ```

2. Add the new package to:

   - the `paths` key in `/tsconfig.json`
   - the `alias` key in `/.storybook/main.js`
   - the `imports` variable in `/.storybook/components/CodeExample/CodeExample.tsx`
   - the new record to Dockerfile

## Linking with other projects

In order to develop or debug Picasso in parallel with your project without the need to publish new Picasso versions, you need to link Picasso to your project. And once finished unlink it.
You will probably notice that linking process links `@toptal/picasso` and `react`. It is due to React restriction of only once instance used in the project [[1]](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14257#issuecomment-439967377) [[2]](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13991#issuecomment-463486871), so we link to Picasso's `react` version.

### Link

To link Picasso follow these steps:

In Picasso project directory:

1. Checkout Picasso project from [GitHub](https://github.com/toptal/picasso)
2. Install Picasso dependencies with `yarn install`
3. Build Picasso inside Picasso package folder (`./packages/picasso/`) with `yarn build:package`
4. Create a link with running in the root path `yarn symlink` (creates all links to Picasso packages and React link)

In your project directory:

1. Link Picasso and React with `yarn link @toptal/picasso react`
2. Start your project and changes in Picasso will be visible in your project!

### Unlink

To unlink Picasso follow these steps:

In your project directory:

1. Unlink Picasso with `yarn unlink @toptal/picasso react`
2. Re-install dependencies with `yarn install --force`

(Optional) In Picasso project directory:

1. Unlink with `yarn symlink:off`
2. Re-install dependencies with `yarn install --force`

### Tree shaking

If you use [davinci-engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@toptal/davinci-engine) to manage your application - tree shaking works by default when you build your project in the `production` mode.

In other cases when you use custom webpack build configuration you should check these three things to make sure you will have Picasso tree-shaked:

1. You run your build in `production` mode
2. You are not transforming your ES modules into `commonjs` during the build process. Usually, it's default behavior of popular babel presets - [modules configuration](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#modules)
3. You have `sideEffects` prop in your `package.json` set to `false` value or don't have it at all

Have a happy tree shaking! :)
